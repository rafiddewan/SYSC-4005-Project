## Running the original policy of the simulation
To run the original policy of the simulation you need to make sure that on Performance.py that the following variable is false:

```IS_ROUND_ROBIN = False```

This will then generate the production run of the simulation in a CSV called ***Priority_Queue_Production_Run.csv***

## Running the alternative policy of the simulation
To run the alternative policy of the simulation you need to make sure that on Performance.py that the following variable is true:

```IS_ROUND_ROBIN = True```

This will then generate the production run of the simulation in a CSV called ***RoundRobin_Production_Run.csv***

## Running Performance.py
To run the Performance.py you must be using Python 3.
